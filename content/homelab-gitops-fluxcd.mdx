### Overview

If you've been following my homelab experiments, you know I love to make things reproducible, self-healing, 
and slightly over-engineered for fun. Lately, I've been exploring FluxCD to bring true GitOps vibes to my 
small k3s homelab.

Here's the story, the why, and the how.

### Why GitOps in a homelab?

I run a small (for now!) k3s cluster with a mix of “essential” services (think Prometheus, Grafana, Jellyfin, Homepage) and 
random experiments. Up until now, updating deployments was a mix of `kubectl apply` and hoping I remembered what I changed.

FluxCD changes that by treating **Git as the single source of truth**. Everything I want running in my cluster lives in a 
Git repo, and Flux automatically syncs it.

### Architecture

The repo structure changed slightly... again, to fit FluxCD. I thought about following the FluxCD official structure, 
but it seems way too over-engineered for my use-case. Even for me hehe!

```
.
├── flux-system/            # GitOps
├── infrastructure/         # Cluster-wide setup
│   └── namespaces/
├── monitoring/             # Monitoring stack
│   ├── grafana/
│   ├── prometheus/
│   ├── kube-state-metrics/
│   ├── node-exporter/
│   └── alertmanager/
├── services/               # Running services
│   ├── homepage/
│   └── jellyfin/
└── scripts/                # Placeholder
```

### Installation

It was quite straight-forward. Install Flux with the official install script, bootstrap it and go.
I spent some time fine-tuning the GitHub PAT to make it have just enough premissions, but that was the
hardest part, honestly.
