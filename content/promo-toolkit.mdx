### How it started

**Promo+ Toolkit** was initially created as a personal side project to learn more about the Electron.js framework. 
I had a recurring task that required a lot of error-prone manual work. Pulling JSON data from multiple sources and then 
manually constructing a JSON object to add to a large metadata file.
I wrote a script to automate the data collection and structuring, and it quickly became the perfect excuse to dive into Electron.js.

### How it's going

After sharing the application with the team and receiving positive feedback, I gradually started adding more functionality,
introduced better error handling, improved both the UI and the user feedback. It is currently used daily by multiple teams for various tasks.

Its current functionalities feature scripts that pull, manipulate, calculate and update/upload data from and to AWS Services (S3, DynamoDB),
specific CSV file merging by common identifiers, and a voucher generator. The list is ever expanding depending on the current requirements. 
Additionally, you can select the AWS profile directly from your `~/.aws/credentials` file and choose the appropriate environment to execute the script. 
The application also performs checks to ensure the profile credentials and environments match and provides user feedback if they don't.

  **NOTE:** Please note that the application is stored in a private GitHub repository so you won't have access to the source code or the download links.

## Future plans

Maintain and improve the application as long as it's useful to me and my colleagues. A migration from AWS to GCP is likely on the to-do list, 
as our product will soon be migrated there.
